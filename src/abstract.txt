This monitoring dataset consists of variable circular plot (VCP) - continuous distance - point count bird observations and site conditions along with extensive habitat data for breeding birds in the National Park Service Heartland Inventory and Monitoring Network Parks. The dataset includes approximately 65,000 individual bird observations covering over 200 bird species observed at 12 NPS park units taken between 2001 and 2022. 

The park units include Agate Fossil Beds National Monument, Nebraska, Arkansas Post National Memorial, Arkansas, Effigy Mounds National Monument, Iowa, George Washington Carver National Monument, Missouri, Herber Hoover National Historic Site, Iowa, Hopewell Culture National Historical Park, Ohio, Homestead National Historical Park, Nebraska, Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial, Indiana, Pea Ridge National Military Park, Arkansas, Pipestone National Monument, Minnesota, Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve, Kansas and Wilson's Creek National Battlefield, Missouri. 

The overall goals of Heartland Inventory and Monitoring Network breeding bird monitoring are to 1) identify significant temporal changes in the species composition and abundance of bird communities that occur on parks during the breeding season, and 2) improve our understanding of relationships between breeding birds and their habitat and the effects of management actions (such as prairie restoration or prescribed fire) on bird populations by examining potential correlations between changes in specific habitat variables (e.g., vegetation structure, ground cover) and changes in bird community composition and abundance.
