Point counts of breeding bird species were taken at NPS parks within the Heartland Inventory and Monitoring Network over 5 min sampling periods using variable circular plot methodology with continuous distance. Observations were taken using a grid sampling design where the size of the grid and number of plots (n = 260 or less) depended on the overall park size. All park units in this study were comparatively small, with areas of approximately 4500 ha (11,000 acres) or less. Site conditions included temperature, wind, rain, cloudcover and noise. Extensive habitat data were gathered at a subset of the bird samples. Habitat observations included canopy height and canopy cover, tree species and basal area, foliar and ground cover, horizontal and vertical vegetation structure and percent vegetation covertypes.
