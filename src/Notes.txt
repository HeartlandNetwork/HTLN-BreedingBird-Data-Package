1) Visually inspect each .csv just to see how extensive the mess is...
Rerun BirdObservationsThru2022_2.sql
Definitely commas in LUT values. How to handle them? Posted this

2) Make a spreadsheet listing every csv file, every column and the 
data type of each column

Develop simple QA/QC tests for column values.
 
1. Categorical data
1.1. Unique list
1.2. Frequency plot 
2. Numerical data
2.1. Summarize with average, min, max
2.2. Histogram of values
3. String data
3.1. Unique list

3) Name QAQC test scripts according to the .csv files they address


4) Start with the hardest one - site observations and birds
